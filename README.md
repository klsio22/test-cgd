## 🚀 Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- React

- Tailwindcss

- Python

- Plone

- Docker

## ✈️ Development

I developed a countdown timer component using Volto ReactJs, which would later be implemented on a Plone server. Additionally, we made an overlay on an existing component, which in this case, was the footer.

## ⚙️ Quick start

### Development Setup

- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- Node 16
- yarn
- Docker

### Install

```shell
git clone git@github.com:collective/test-cgd.git
cd test-cgd
make install
```

### Start

Start the Backend (http://localhost:8080/)

```shell
make start-backend
```

Start the Frontend (http://localhost:3000/)

```shell
make start-frontend
```

## 🏗️ Structure

This monorepo is composed by two distinct codebases: api and frontend.

- **backend**: API (Backend) Plone installation using pip (not buildout). Includes a policy package named test_cgd
- **frontend**: React (Volto) package named frontend

### Reasoning

- Repo contains all codebase needed to run the site (excluding existing addons for Plone and React).
- Github Workflows are triggered based on changes on each codebase (see .github/workflows)
- Easier to create Docker images for each codebase
- Showcase Plone installation/setup without buildout

## 📒 Linters and Formatting

There are some hooks to run lint checks on the code. If you want to automatically format them, you can run

`make format`

in the root folder or especifically in each backend or frontend folders.

Linters commands are available in each backend and frontend folder.

## 👨‍🏫 Acceptance tests

There are `Makefile` commands in place:

`build-test-acceptance-server`: Build Acceptance Backend Server Docker image that it's being used afterwards. Must be run before running the tests, if the backend code has changed.

`start-test-acceptance-server`: Start server fixture in docker (previous build required)

`start-test-acceptance-frontend`: Start the Core Acceptance Frontend Fixture in dev mode

`test-acceptance`: Start Core Cypress Acceptance Tests in dev mode
